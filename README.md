# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction
The solution analyses customer characteristics to assess which customers are more likely to leave the telecom service provider.


## Product overview

Customer churn refers to the loss of existing clients or customers. Customer loyalty is important since acquiring a new customer is much costlier than retaining an existing customer. Moreover, longstanding customers are also likely to buy more products and spend more than new ones. Therefore, monitoring churn rates and predicting customers vulnerable to attrition becomes important. This solution focuses on identifying bank customers who are more likely to close their account and leave the bank. During the training stage, the solution automatically conducts feature interaction on the training data and selects a subset of features based on feature importance. It then trains multiple models and identifies the best performing model. This model is then selected for prediction on new data. The product enables organizations to identify individuals most likely to defect, and act towards retaining them.
